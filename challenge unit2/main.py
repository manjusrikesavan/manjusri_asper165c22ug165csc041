'''Implement a class called BankAccount that represents a bank account. The class should have private
attributes for account number, account holder name, and account balance. Include methods to
deposit money, withdraw money, and display the account balance. Ensure that the account balance

is batting" and "The bowler is bowling", respectively. Write a program to create objects of both the
Batsman and Bowler classes and call the play() method for each object.'''
